                <h3>The story of renting out air mattress into a $25 billion company- AirBnb</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2009 the founders of AirBnb thought they are verge of shutting down all operations, As the business showed 
                    No signs of growth and the revenue dropped to a mere $200 a week, which was shared between all three co-founders
                    Then the trio started to figure out why the traction was very low. And soon they found the problem which was hindering 
                    Their growth</p>
                
                    <p>
                    There's a popular saying in hindi "Jo dikhta hai wo hi bikta hai" means what is seen is sold. After analyzing the 
                    Pictures of their listings they found that they were of mediocre quality and some even blurry and pixelated. That time 
                    The listing owners didn't had great camera quality smartphones to upload high resolution images of the rooms, And 
                    Due to this their potential customers didn't liked what they were paying for and backed off. </p>
                
                    <p>
                    Long story short, just after the realization they quickly hired someone with a professional camera and took high
                    Resolution images of the listings.
                    
                    Soon the traffic started to grow on their website, and the revenue doubled to $400 in less than a week, this was a growth
                    Company hadn't seen in months, This way the AirBnb went on to profitability and there was no looking back.</p>
