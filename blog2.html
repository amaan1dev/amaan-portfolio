                    <strong>What is crypto-currency?</strong><br>
                    <br>
                    A crypto currency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure, create and control its transactions. Unlike traditional currencies, which are issued by central banks, crypto currency has no central monetary authority, operating independently of a central bank.

                    </p>

                    <p>At present money transactions from one person to another person go through financial institutions such as banks. The invention of cryptocurrency allowed user to user transactions without the need of intermediary institutions. Through cryptocurrency, users can directly send money to other users.</p>

                    <p>
                        Bitcoin is the first crypto currency which came to public notice in 2009. Crypto currency can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. This bitcoin is built using blockchain technology. There are a limited number of coins. And Every bitcoin has a unique code. Every transaction of the coin is stored as a block, and all the transactions for the particular coin are connected like a chain, and hence the name blockchain technology.

                        According to a recent survey, India is the fastest growing cryptocurrency market in the world. As per a new study, India is the quickest developing cryptocurrency market in the world. It has developed at a dramatic rate throughout recent years, and its development rate has been quicker than that of some other countries.

                   <p>
                    The Indian government is currently formulating policy on Web 3.0. To be a huge player in the worldwide Web 3 economy, it should take part in the worldwide strategy improvement and adjust its strategies to this quick world. Up to that point, Indian web3 startups should battle with a generally safe administrative climate.

                    In the next 12 months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to launch a central bank-backed digital currency. A ‚Äúdigital rupee‚Äù would be an important proving ground, demonstrating the potential for cryptocurrencies as a force for good in driving efficiencies within payment systems. Furthermore, central-backed ‚Äúsovereign‚Äù digital currencies will be seen as a safer starting point than other altcoins with a more volatile store of value.

 

For cryptocurrency to hit the mainstream well and truly in India it will require the digital rupee to hit the ground running. It will also need millennial and Gen Z citizens to act and hop aboard the crypto and blockchain bandwagon. The Times of India state that female participation in crypto has already risen by more than 1,000% in the last few years. Meanwhile, two-thirds (66%) of active users are aged 18-34 years of age.
